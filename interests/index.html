            <li class="description">I am honestly a big reality tv junkie and I owe it all to my mom.
              I remeber growing up, my mom and I would alwayd watch shows like the Bachelor or
              Bacheloratte, Dancing With the Stars, and Keep Up With the Kardasians. And ever
              since then, I've just been hooked! My favorite reality tv show is The Challenge and
              I love it so much that I wasted 4 months watching 32 seasons of it (Not really
              something I should be proud of lol).</li>
          </ul>
          <li class="topic">Music</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="description">Growing up, I was always surrounded by all types of music and
              because of this, I love all types of music. My main playlist is super dipolar and I am
              constantly adding new songs to it everyday. My playlist is so dipolar that in one
              moment I will be listening to System of the Down and then it will shuffle to Playboy
              Carti or Bad Bunny (This is probably one of the main reasons why I never get AUX lol).</li>
          </ul>
          <li class="topic">Sneakers</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="description">In the past year, I've gotten into sneakers. Right now I have 5
              pairs of Jordans and one pair of Yeezys. My Yeezy collection is slowly growing, but
              since not all of their shoes are pretty lol, I have yet buy any new ones. I buy all my
              sneakers on retail, because re-sale is just way to expenesive and I personally rather
              pay half the price and take my chances in the draw. Honestly, this is a very expenisve
              hobby lol, but for me shoes are an important part if an outfit. Also, you can never
              have too many shoes. If you want to know more about sneakers and how to get them GQ has
              a good article explaining all of this.
