        <ol>
          <li>Reality TV</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I am honestly a big reality tv junkie and I owe it all to my mom. I remeber
              growing up, my mom and I would alwayd watch shows like the Bachelor or
              Bacheloratte, Dancing With the Stars, and Keep Up With the Kardasians. And ever
              since then, I've just been hooked! My favorite reality tv show is The Challenge and
              I love it so much that I wasted 4 months watching 32 seasons of it (Not really
              something I should be proud of lol).</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Music</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Growing up, I was always surrounded by all types of music and because of this, I
              love all types of music. My main playlist is super dipolar and I am constantly
              adding new songs to it everyday. My playlist is so dipolar that in one moment I will
              be listening to System of the Down and then it will shuffle to Playboy Carti or Bad
              Bunny (This is probably one of the main reasons why I never get AUX lol).</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Sneakers</li>
          <ul>
            <li>(To be continued)</li>
          </ul>
