          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, welcome to my site! This website is my first site, and I am currently open to any
            advice or criticism to help make it better! My name is Chloe, and I am currently a
            second-year and full-time student at the Illinois Institute of Technology. I was born
            and raised in Chicago and currently reside in Albany Park. I work part-time at Menards
            ("Where you always save big money!"). I am a huge animal lover, and if I could, I would
            own a farm. I currently have a cat named Romeo, and he is the most cutest cat ever! I
            want another cat or dog (I honestly want both), but my mom is just not folding. I am a
            proud Guatemalan American, but I have yet to go to Guatemala (which is pretty
            disappointing), but I hope to go the next year to see where my family is from.
